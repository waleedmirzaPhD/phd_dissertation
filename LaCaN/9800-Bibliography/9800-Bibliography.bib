	abstract = {We study the dynamics and phase behaviour of a dry suspension of microtubules and molecular motors. We obtain a set of continuum equations by rigorously coarse graining a microscopic model where motor-induced interactions lead to parallel or antiparallel ordering. Through numerical simulations{,} we show that this model generically creates either stable stripes{,} or a never-settling pattern where stripes periodically form{,} rotate and then split up. We derive a minimal model which displays the same instability as the full model{,} and clarifies the underlying physical mechanism. The necessary ingredients are an extensile flux arising from microtubule sliding and an interfacial torque favouring ordering along density gradients. We argue that our minimal model unifies various previous observations of chaotic behaviour in dry active matter into a general universality class.},

@article{Yasunaga:2022uh,
	abstract = {Several tissues contain cells with multiple motile cilia that generate a fluid or particle flow to support development and organ functions; defective motility causes human disease. Developmental cues orient motile cilia, but how cilia are locked into their final position to maintain a directional flow is not understood. Here we find that the actin cytoskeleton is highly dynamic during early development of multiciliated cells (MCCs). While apical actin bundles become increasingly more static, subapical actin filaments are nucleated from the distal tip of ciliary rootlets. Anchorage of these subapical actin filaments requires the presence of microridge-like structures formed during MCC development, and the activity of Nonmuscle Myosin II. Optogenetic manipulation of Ezrin, a core component of the microridge actin-anchoring complex, or inhibition of Myosin Light Chain Kinase interfere with rootlet anchorage and orientation. These observations identify microridge-like structures as an essential component of basal body rootlet anchoring in MCCs.},

@article{BEREITERHAHN1979316,
	abstract = {The surface of fish epidermis cells is characterized by a varying pattern of microridges. Their width is about 0.3 μm and the height may reach values up to 1 μm. Under certain conditions these microridges can be maintained in cultures of epidermis derived from guppy embryos after outgrowth on glass coverslips. In such preparations indirect immunofluorescence microscopy allows the identification of actin and α-actinin as characteristic components of the microridges. The distribution of prekeratin-related tonofilaments (7- to 10-nm filaments) was visualized by the same method. A good correlation between the display of the microridges and accumulations of tonofilaments was observed, while the organization of microtubules seemed to be without any direct relation to the surface structures. The highly dynamic activity of microridges and their changing length is demonstrated by time-lapse cinemicrography. Ridges and their precursors, which are small zones of increased optical density, display in histochemical procedures a strong ATPase activity. The course of filaments in the ridges and in the subjacent terminal web has been studied also by electron microscopy. Epidermis cells of the midbody region of female guppies (Poecilia reticulata, Peters), the sea horse (Hippocampus kuda, Bleeker), and embryonic guppy epidermis in culture have been used. Treatment of adult guppy epidermis with Triton X-100 prior to fixation facilitated the interpretation of the organization of filaments in the microridges and the terminal web. From these observations a similarity between microridges and microvilli is discussed. The major similarities involve a core of actin filaments attached to the plasma membrane and a thickened glycocalyx. Filaments are arranged as bundles along the length of the ridges, a behavior which is most pronounced in the concentric ridges of the flame cone cells of sea horse epidermis. A model for the formation of the microridges is proposed which explains the strong interdependence of the development of surface protrusions and the organization of a terminal web. Folding up of the plasmalemma is thought to be brought about by the force generated by filaments inserting at the prospective flank region of the developing microridge. These filaments are supposed to stick in the subjacent terminal web and intermingle with tonofilaments. The course of filaments from opposite flanks is marked by a crossover under the center of the ridge. The relation of these findings to observations on the reformation of microvilli is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {{Cellular protrusions create complex cell surface topographies, but biomechanical mechanisms regulating their formation and arrangement are largely unknown. To study how protrusions form, we focused on the morphogenesis of microridges, elongated actin-based structures that are arranged in maze-like patterns on the apical surfaces of zebrafish skin cells. Microridges form by accreting simple finger-like precursors. Live imaging demonstrated that microridge morphogenesis is linked to apical constriction. A nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) reporter revealed pulsatile contractions of the actomyosin cortex, and inhibiting NMII blocked apical constriction and microridge formation. A biomechanical model suggested that contraction reduces surface tension to permit the fusion of precursors into microridges. Indeed, reducing surface tension with hyperosmolar media promoted microridge formation. In anisotropically stretched cells, microridges formed by precursor fusion along the stretch axis, which computational modeling explained as a consequence of stretch-induced cortical flow. Collectively, our results demonstrate how contraction within the 2D plane of the cortex can pattern 3D cell surfaces.}},

@article{https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.23965,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT Microridges are highly distinctive ``fingerprint''-patterned structures situated on the outer surface of superficial layer cells of the epithelium. An F-actin-based cytoskeleton is the underlying core structural component of microridges. The basis for much of what is known about microridges has been provided by in vivo and in vitro fish epithelial systems. Nonetheless the microridge literature is quite small, especially when compared with other actin-based cellular structures such as those involved in cell motility. A PubMed search of the terms ``Microridges'' yields 261 citations from the mid-1970s to the writing of this review. ``Microplicae,'' an alternative name for microridges, and ``Actin Microridges'' search terms give 204 and 8 references, respectively, in the same time period. By comparison a search of ``Lamellipodia'' over the same time period yields over 6,400 citations for this important motility structure while a search of the associated ``filopodia'' results in close to 7,300 articles. Despite the near-ubiquity of microridges in epithelia across species the study of these structures has clearly been neglected. In-depth analysis of microridge molecular composition is very limited while their function remains unclear. This review draws upon information derived from studies of fish as well as mammalian species to provide a more comprehensive view of these structures. The wide-spread distribution of these structures between species and various tissues indicate the microridges have important and common functions in healthy organisms. Conversely, disease conditions may show alterations in microridge structure and function and thus warrant further investigation.

@article{DINWIDDIE2014404,
	abstract = {The wings of butterflies and moths consist of dorsal and ventral epidermal surfaces that give rise to overlapping layers of scales and hairs (Lepidoptera, ``scale wing''). Wing scales (average length ~200µm) are homologous to insect bristles (macrochaetes), and their colors create the patterns that characterize lepidopteran wings. The topology and surface sculpture of wing scales vary widely, and this architectural complexity arises from variations in the developmental program of the individual scale cells of the wing epithelium. One of the more striking features of lepidopteran wing scales are the longitudinal ridges that run the length of the mature (dead) cell, gathering the cuticularized scale cell surface into pleats on the sides of each scale. While also present around the periphery of other insect bristles and hairs, longitudinal ridges in lepidopteran wing scales gain new significance for their creation of iridescent color through microribs and lamellae. Here we show the dynamics of the highly organized F-actin filaments during scale cell development, and present experimental manipulations of actin polymerization that reveal the essential role of this cytoskeletal component in wing scale elongation and the positioning of longitudinal ribs.},

@article{Gross:2019ug,
	abstract = {Spontaneous pattern formation in Turing systems relies on feedback. But patterns in cells and tissues seldom form spontaneously---instead they are controlled by regulatory biochemical interactions that provide molecular guiding cues. The relationship between these guiding cues and feedback in controlled biological pattern formation remains unclear. Here, we explore this relationship during cell-polarity establishment in the one-cell-stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. We quantify the strength of two feedback systems that operate during polarity establishment: feedback between polarity proteins and the actomyosin cortex, and mutual antagonism among polarity proteins. We characterize how these feedback systems are modulated by guiding cues from the centrosome, an organelle regulating cell cycle progression. By coupling a mass-conserved Turing-like reaction--diffusion system for polarity proteins to an active-gel description of the actomyosin cortex, we reveal a transition point beyond which feedback ensures self-organized polarization, even when cues are removed. Notably, the system switches from a guide-dominated to a feedback-dominated regime well beyond this transition point, which ensures robustness. Together, these results reveal a general criterion for controlling biological pattern-forming systems: feedback remains subcritical to avoid unstable behaviour, and molecular guiding cues drive the system beyond a transition point for pattern formation.},

	abstract = {Proteins control many vital functions in living cells, such as cell growth and cell division. Reliable coordination of these functions requires the spatial and temporal organization of proteins inside cells, which encodes information about the cell's geometry and the cell-cycle stage. The study of such protein patterns has long focused around formation in uniform environments. However, in recent years, it has become evident that spatial heterogeneities are essential for protein patterning, and various guiding cues in the cell or at the cell boundary can be exploited to reliably control protein pattern formation. We review how protein patterns are guided by cell size and shape, by other protein patterns that act as templates, and by the mechanical properties of the cell. The basic mechanisms of guided pattern formation are elucidated with reference to observations in various biological model organisms. We posit that understanding the controlled formation of protein patterns in cells will be an essential part of understanding information processing in living systems.},

	abstract = { The development of organisms starting from their zygotic state involves a tight integration of the myriad biochemical signaling interactions with the mechanical forces that eventually pattern and shape the resulting embryo. In the past decade, it has become increasingly evident that several important developmental processes involve mechanical forces in an essential manner. In this review, we highlight the multifaceted role of mechanics in pattern formation, from protein and cell sorting to the generation of tissue shape. We then review the ways in which the active cellular cytoskeleton self-organizes to form dynamic patterns. Finally, we focus on mechanochemical feedback, where signaling proteins can establish patterns via coupling to the activity of the cytoskeleton. Throughout the review, we focus on the generic physical principles of the establishment of active mechanochemical patterns and point toward future directions in studying how the principles of mechanics and chemistry combine to drive morphogenetic pattern formation. },

	abstract = {In active matter systems, the infusion of energy and motion drives ordering processes. Huber et al. present a combination of experiments and numerical simulations on an active matter system consisting of actin filaments propelled across a surface by surface-attached myosin motor proteins. Adding a depletion agent---polymer chains that weakened interactions between the actin filaments---drove the system between ferromagnetic (polar) and nematic (liquid crystal) ordering. Science, this issue p. 255 Active systems can support the coexistence of isotropic, nematic, and polar phases. Active systems can produce a far greater variety of ordered patterns than conventional equilibrium systems. In particular, transitions between disorder and either polar- or nematically ordered phases have been predicted and observed in two-dimensional active systems. However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active system. These results provide a pathway by which living systems can express different types of order by using identical building blocks.},

	abstract = {The emergence of macroscopic order and patterns is a central paradigm in systems of (self-)propelled agents and a key component in the structuring of many biological systems. The relationships between the ordering process and the underlying microscopic interactions have been extensively explored both experimentally and theoretically. While emerging patterns often show one specific symmetry (e.g., nematic lane patterns or polarized traveling flocks), depending on the symmetry of the alignment interactions patterns with different symmetries can apparently coexist. Indeed, recent experiments with an actomysin motility assay suggest that polar and nematic patterns of actin filaments can interact and dynamically transform into each other. However, theoretical understanding of the mechanism responsible remains elusive. Here, we present a kinetic approach complemented by a hydrodynamic theory for agents with mixed alignment symmetries, which captures the experimentally observed phenomenology and provides a theoretical explanation for the coexistence and interaction of patterns with different symmetries. We show that local, pattern-induced symmetry breaking can account for dynamically coexisting patterns with different symmetries. Specifically, in a regime with moderate densities and a weak polar bias in the alignment interaction, nematic bands show a local symmetry-breaking instability within their high-density core region, which induces the formation of polar waves along the bands. These instabilities eventually result in a self-organized system of nematic bands and polar waves that dynamically transform into each other. Our study reveals a mutual feedback mechanism between pattern formation and local symmetry breaking in active matter that has interesting consequences for structure formation in biological systems.},

	abstract = {The mitotic spindle is a highly dynamic bipolar structure that emerges from the self-organization of microtubules, molecular motors and other proteins. Sustained motor-driven poleward flows of dynamic microtubules play a key role in the bipolar organization of spindles. However, it is not understood how the local activity of motor proteins generates these large-scale coherent poleward flows. Here we show that a gelation transition enables long-range microtubule transport causing the spindles to self-organize into two oppositely polarized microtubule gels. Laser ablation experiments reveal that local active stresses generated at the spindle midplane propagate through the structure, thereby driving global coherent microtubule flows. Simulations show that microtubule gels undergoing rapid turnover can exhibit long stress relaxation times, in agreement with the long-range flows observed in experiments. Finally, our model predicts that in the presence of branching microtubule nucleation, either disrupting such flows or decreasing the network connectivity can lead to a microtubule polarity reversal in spindles. We experimentally confirm this inversion of polarity by abolishing the microtubule transport in spindles. Overall, we uncover a connection between spindle rheology and architecture in spindle self-organization.},

	abstract = { In migrating fibroblasts actomyosin II bundles are graded polarity (GP) bundles, a distinct organization to stress fibers. GP bundles are important for powering cell migration, yet have an unknown mechanism of formation. Electron microscopy and the fate of photobleached marks show actin filaments undergoing retrograde flow in filopodia, and the lamellipodium are structurally and dynamically linked with stationary GP bundles within the lamella. An individual filopodium initially protrudes, but then becomes separated from the tip of the lamellipodium and seeds the formation of a new GP bundle within the lamella. In individual live cells expressing both GFP-myosin II and RFP-actin, myosin II puncta localize to the base of an individual filopodium an average 28 s before the filopodium seeds the formation of a new GP bundle. Associated myosin II is stationary with respect to the substratum in new GP bundles. Inhibition of myosin II motor activity in live cells blocks appearance of new GP bundles in the lamella, without inhibition of cell protrusion in the same timescale. We conclude retrograde F-actin flow and myosin II activity within the leading cell edge delivers F-actin to the lamella to seed the formation of new GP bundles. },

	abstract = {{Cell and tissue morphogenesis depend on the production and spatial organization of tensional forces in the actin cytoskeleton. Actin network architecture is made of distinct modules characterized by specific filament organizations. The assembly of these modules are well described, but their integration in a cellular network is less understood. Here, we investigated the mechanism regulating the interplay between network architecture and the geometry of the extracellular environment of the cell. We found that α-actinin, a filament crosslinker, is essential for network symmetry to be consistent with extracellular microenvironment symmetry. It is required for the interconnection of transverse arcs with radial fibres to ensure an appropriate balance between forces at cell adhesions and across the actin network. Furthermore, this connectivity appeared necessary for the ability of the cell to integrate and to adapt to complex patterns of extracellular cues as they migrate. Our study has unveiled a role of actin filament crosslinking in the spatial integration of mechanical forces that ensures the adaptation of intracellular symmetry axes in accordance with the geometry of extracellular cues.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.}},

	abstract = {{The repair of injured tissue must occur rapidly to prevent microbial invasion and maintain tissue integrity. Epithelial tissues in particular, which serve as a barrier against the external environment, must repair efficiently in order to restore their primary function. Here we analyze the effect of different parameters on the epithelial wound repair process in the late stage Drosophila embryo using in vivo wound assays, expression of cytoskeleton and membrane markers, and mutant analysis. We define four distinct phases in the repair process, expansion, coalescence, contraction and closure, and describe the molecular dynamics of each phase. Specifically, we find that myosin, E-cadherin, Echinoid, the plasma membrane, microtubules and the Cdc42 small GTPase respond dynamically during wound repair. We demonstrate that perturbations of each of these components result in specific impairments to the wound healing process. Our results show that embryonic epithelial wound repair is mediated by two simultaneously acting mechanisms: crawling driven by cellular protrusions and actomyosin ring contraction along the leading edge of the wound.}},

	abstract = {Cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells is often accompanied by actomyosin cortical flow. Over 30 years ago, Borisy and White proposed that cortical flow converging upon the cell equator compresses the actomyosin network to mechanically align actin filaments. However, actin filaments also align via search-and-capture, and to what extent compression by flow or active alignment drive furrow formation remains unclear. Here, we quantify the dynamical organization of actin filaments at the onset of ring assembly in the \textit{C. elegans} zygote, and provide a framework for determining emergent actomyosin material parameters by the use of active nematic gel theory. We characterize flow-alignment coupling, and verify at a quantitative level that compression by flow drives ring formation. Finally, we find that active alignment enhances but is not required for ring formation. Our work characterizes the physical mechanisms of actomyosin ring formation and highlights the role of flow as a central organizer of actomyosin network architecture.},

The study of this kind of active system was absent from conventional physics and there was a need for both new theories and new experiments. The field that has emerged in recent years to fill this gap is underpinned by a theory that takes into account the transduction of chemical energy on the molecular scale. This formalism has advanced our understanding of living systems, but it has also had an impact on research in physics per se. Here, we describe this developing field, its relevance to biology, the novelty it conveys to other areas of physics and some of the challenges in store for the future of active gel physics.},

Various hypotheses explain cell sorting and tissue organization on the basis of the adhesive and mechanical properties of the constituent cells1. However, validating these hypotheses has been difficult due to the lack of appropriate tools to measure these parameters. Here we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to quantify the adhesive and mechanical properties of individual ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm progenitor cells from gastrulating zebrafish embryos. Combining these data with tissue self-assembly in vitro and the sorting behaviour of progenitors in vivo, we have shown that differential actomyosin-dependent cell-cortex tension, regulated by Nodal/TGFβ-signalling (transforming growth factor β), constitutes a key factor that directs progenitor-cell sorting. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for Nodal-controlled cell-cortex tension in germ-layer organization during gastrulation.},

	abstract = {Lipid bilayers are unique soft materials operating in general in the low Reynolds limit. While their shape is predominantly dominated by curvature elasticity as in a solid shell, their in-plane behavior is that of a largely inextensible viscous fluid. Furthermore, lipid membranes are extremely responsive to chemical stimuli. Because in their biological context they are continuously brought out-of-equilibrium mechanically or chemically, it is important to understand their dynamics. Here, we introduce Onsager's variational principle as a general and transparent modeling tool for lipid bilayer dynamics. We introduce this principle with elementary examples, and then use it to study the sorption of curved proteins on lipid membranes.},

@article{Dong,
	abstract = {{Cell elongation is a fundamental process that allows cells and tissues to adopt new shapes and functions. During notochord tubulogenesis in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, a dramatic elongation of individual cells takes place that lengthens the notochord and, consequently, the entire embryo. We find a novel dynamic actin- and non-muscle myosin II-containing constriction midway along the anteroposterior aspect of each notochord cell during this process. Both actin polymerization and myosin II activity are required for the constriction and cell elongation. Discontinuous localization of myosin II in the constriction indicates that the actomyosin network produces local contractions along the circumference. This reveals basal constriction by the actomyosin network as a novel mechanism for cell elongation. Following elongation, the notochord cells undergo a mesenchymal-epithelial transition and form two apical domains at opposite ends. Extracellular lumens then form at the apical surfaces. We show that cortical actin and Ciona ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) are essential for lumen formation and that a polarized network of microtubules, which contributes to lumen development, forms in an actin-dependent manner at the apical cortex. Later in notochord tubulogenesis, when notochord cells initiate a bi-directional crawling movement on the notochordal sheath, the microtubule network rotates 90$\,^{\circ}$ and becomes organized as parallel bundles extending towards the leading edges of tractive lamellipodia. This process is required for the correct organization of actin-based protrusions and subsequent lumen coalescence. In summary, we establish the contribution of the actomyosin and microtubule networks to notochord tubulogenesis and reveal extensive crosstalk and regulation between these two cytoskeleton components.}},

	abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is a critical regulator of cytoplasmic architecture and mechanics, essential in a myriad of physiological processes. Here we demonstrate a liquid phase of actin filaments in the presence of the physiological cross-linker, filamin. Filamin condenses short actin filaments into spindle-shaped droplets, or tactoids, with shape dynamics consistent with a continuum model of anisotropic liquids. We find that cross-linker density controls the droplet shape and deformation timescales, consistent with a variable interfacial tension and viscosity. Near the liquid--solid transition, cross-linked actin bundles show behaviors reminiscent of fluid threads, including capillary instabilities and contraction. These data reveal a liquid droplet phase of actin, demixed from the surrounding solution and dominated by interfacial tension. These results suggest a mechanism to control organization, morphology, and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton.},

	abstract = {The cytoskeleton forms a variety of steady-state, subcellular structures that are maintained by continuous fluxes of molecules and energy. Understanding such self-organizing structures is not only crucial for cell biology but also poses a fundamental challenge for physics, since these systems are active materials that behave drastically differently from matter at or near equilibrium. Active liquid crystal theories have been developed to study the self-organization of cytoskeletal filaments in in vitro systems of purified components. However, it has been unclear how relevant these simplified approaches are for understanding biological structures, which can be composed of hundreds of distinct proteins. Here we show that a suitably constructed active liquid crystal theory produces remarkably accurate predictions of the behaviors of metaphase spindles---the cytoskeletal structure, composed largely of microtubules and associated proteins, that segregates chromosomes during cell division.},

	abstract = {Growing experimental evidence indicates that topological defects could serve as organizing centers in the morphogenesis of tissues. Here, we provide a quantitative explanation for this phenomenon, rooted in the buckling theory of deformable active polar liquid crystals. Using a combination of linear stability analysis and computational fluid dynamics, we demonstrate that active layers, such as confined cell monolayers, are unstable to the formation of protrusions in the presence of disclinations. The instability originates from an interplay between the focusing of the elastic forces, mediated by defects, and the renormalization of the system's surface tension by the active flow. The posttransitional regime is also characterized by several complex morphodynamical processes, such as oscillatory deformations, droplet nucleation, and active turbulence. Our findings offer an explanation of recent observations on tissue morphogenesis and shed light on the dynamics of active surfaces in general. Far from being mere imperfections, topological defects can help tissues develop features such as tentacles and protrusions.},

The surface of a cylinder has no intrinsic curvature and only extrinsic curvature. A nematic field reacts to the extrinsic curvature by trying to align with the lowest principle curvature, in this case parallel to the long axis of the cylinder. When nematics are sufficiently active, there is a proliferation of defects arising from a bend or splay instability depending on the nature of the active stress. The extrinsic curvature of the cylinder breaks the rotational symmetry of this process, implying that defects are created parallel or perpendicular to the cylinder depending on whether the active nematic is contractile or extensile.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new method, the Local Monge Parametrizations (LMP) method, to approximate tensor fields on general surfaces given by a collection of local parametrizations, e.g. as in finite element or NURBS surface representations. Our goal is to use this method to solve numerically tensor-valued partial differential equations (PDEs) on surfaces. Previous methods use scalar potentials to numerically describe vector fields on surfaces, at the expense of requiring higher-order derivatives of the approximated fields and limited to simply connected surfaces, or represent tangential tensor fields as tensor fields in 3D subjected to constraints, thus increasing the essential number of degrees of freedom. In contrast, the LMP method uses an optimal number of degrees of freedom to represent a tensor, is general with regards to the topology of the surface, and does not increase the order of the PDEs governing the tensor fields. The main idea is to construct maps between the element parametrizations and a local Monge parametrization around each node. We test the LMP method by approximating in a least-squares sense different vector and tensor fields on simply connected and genus-1 surfaces. Furthermore, we apply the LMP method to two physical models on surfaces, involving a tension-driven flow (vector-valued PDE) and nematic ordering (tensor-valued PDE), on different topologies. The LMP method thus solves the long-standing problem of the interpolation of tensors on general surfaces with an optimal number of degrees of freedom.},

@article{cortes2020,
	abstract = {Molecular motors drive cytoskeletal rearrangements to change cell shape. Myosins are the motors that move, cross-link, and modify the actin cytoskeleton. The primary force generator in contractile actomyosin networks is nonmuscle myosin II (NMMII), a molecular motor that assembles into ensembles that bind, slide, and cross-link actin filaments (F-actin). The multivalence of NMMII ensembles and their multiple roles have confounded the resolution of crucial questions, including how the number of NMMII subunits affects dynamics and what affects the relative contribution of ensembles' cross-linking versus motoring activities. Because biophysical measurements of ensembles are sparse, modeling of actomyosin networks has aided in discovering the complex behaviors of NMMII ensembles. Myosin ensembles have been modeled via several strategies with variable discretization or coarse graining and unbinding dynamics, and although general assumptions that simplify motor ensembles result in global contractile behaviors, it remains unclear which strategies most accurately depict cellular activity. Here, we used an agent-based platform, Cytosim, to implement several models of NMMII ensembles. Comparing the effects of bond type, we found that ensembles of catch-slip and catch motors were the best force generators and binders of filaments. Slip motor ensembles were capable of generating force but unbound frequently, resulting in slower contractile rates of contractile networks. Coarse graining of these ensemble types from two sets of 16 motors on opposite ends of a stiff rod to two binders, each representing 16 motors, reduced force generation, contractility, and the total connectivity of filament networks for all ensemble types. A parallel cluster model, previously used to describe ensemble dynamics via statistical mechanics, allowed better contractility with coarse graining, though connectivity was still markedly reduced for this ensemble type with coarse graining. Together, our results reveal substantial tradeoffs associated with the process of coarse graining NMMII ensembles and highlight the robustness of discretized catch-slip ensembles in modeling actomyosin networks.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments on vesicles formed from block copolymers with liquid-crystalline side chains reveal a rich variety of vesicle morphologies. The additional internal order (``structure'') developed by these self-assembled block copolymer vesicles can lead to significantly deformed vesicles as a result of the delicate interplay between two-dimensional ordering and vesicle shape. The inevitable topological defects in structured vesicles of spherical topology also play an essential role in controlling the final vesicle morphology. Here we develop a minimal theoretical model for the morphology of the membrane structure with internal nematic/smectic order. Using both analytic and numerical approaches, we show that the possible low free energy morphologies include nano-size cylindrical micelles (nano-fibers), faceted tetrahedral vesicles, and ellipsoidal vesicles, as well as cylindrical vesicles. The tetrahedral vesicle is a particularly fascinating example of a faceted liquid-crystalline membrane. Faceted liquid vesicles may lead to the design of supramolecular structures with tetrahedral symmetry and new classes of nano-carriers.},

	abstract = {Mechanochemical processes in thin biological structures, such as the cellular cortex or epithelial sheets, play a key role during the morphogenesis of cells and tissues. In particular, they are responsible for the dynamical organization of active stresses that lead to flows and deformations of the material. Consequently, advective transport redistributes force-generating molecules and thereby contributes to a complex mechanochemical feedback loop. It has been shown in fixed geometries that this mechanism enables patterning, but the interplay of these processes with shape changes of the material remains to be explored. In this work, we study the fully self-organized shape dynamics using the theory of active fluids on deforming surfaces and develop a numerical approach to solve the corresponding force and torque balance equations. We describe the spontaneous generation of nontrivial surface shapes, shape oscillations, and directed surface flows that resemble peristaltic waves from self-organized, mechanochemical processes on the deforming surface. Our approach provides opportunities to explore the dynamics of self-organized active surfaces and can help to understand the role of shape as an integral element of the mechanochemical organization of morphogenetic processes.},

	abstract = {The cell cortex is a thin layer beneath the plasma membrane that gives animal cells mechanical resistance and drives most of their shape changes, from migration, division to multicellular morphogenesis. It is mainly composed of actin filaments, actin binding proteins, and myosin molecular motors. Constantly stirred by myosin motors and under fast renewal, this material may be well described by viscous and contractile active-gel theories. Here, we assume that the cortex is a thin viscous shell with non-negligible curvature and use asymptotic expansions to find the leading-order equations describing its shape dynamics, starting from constitutive equations for an incompressible viscous active gel. Reducing the three-dimensional equations leads to a Koiter-like shell theory, where both resistance to stretching and bending rates are present. Constitutive equations are completed by a kinematical equation describing the evolution of the cortex thickness with turnover. We show that tension and moment resultants depend not only on the shell deformation rate and motor activity but also on the active turnover of the material, which may also exert either contractile or extensile stress. Using the finite-element method, we implement our theory numerically to study two biological examples of drastic cell shape changes: osmotic shocks and cell division. Our work provides a numerical implementation of thin active viscous layers and a generic theoretical framework to develop shell theories for slender active biological structures.},

Biopolymer filaments, cross-linking proteins, and enzymatically active motor proteins collectively self-organize into various precise cytoskeletal assemblies critical for specific biological functions. An outstanding question is how the precise spatial organization arises from the component macromolecules. We develop a system to investigate simple physical mechanisms of self-organization in biological assemblies. Using a minimal set of purified proteins, we create droplets of cross-linked biopolymer filaments. Through the addition of enzymatically active motor proteins, we construct composite assemblies, evocative of cellular structures such as spindles, where the inherent anisotropy drives motor self-organization, droplet deformation, and division into two droplets. These results suggest that simple physical principles underlie self-organization in complex biological assemblies and inform bioinspired materials design.},

	abstract = {Topological defects are an essential part of the structure and dynamics of all liquid crystals{,} and they are particularly important in experiments and simulations on active liquid crystals. In a recent paper{,} Vromans and Giomi [Soft Matter{,} 2016{,} 12{,} 6490] pointed out that topological defects are not point-like objects but actually have orientational properties{,} which strongly affect the energetics and motion of the defects. That paper developed a mathematical formalism which describes the orientational properties as vectors. Here{,} we agree with the basic concept of defect orientation{,} but we suggest an alternative mathematical formalism. We represent the defect orientation by a tensor{,} with a rank that depends on the topological charge: rank 1 for a charge of +1/2{,} rank 3 for a charge of −1/2. Using this tensor formalism{,} we calculate the orientation-dependent interaction between defects{,} and we present numerical simulations of defect motion.},

@article{khoromskaia2017,
	abstract = {We present a hydrodynamic model for a thin spherical shell of active nematic liquid crystal with an arbitrary configuration of defects. The active flows generated by defects in the director lead to the formation of stable vortices, analogous to those seen in confined systems in flat geometries, which generate effective dynamics for four +1/2 defects that reproduces the tetrahedral to planar oscillations observed in experiments. As the activity is increased and two counterrotating vortices dominate the flow, the defects are drawn more tightly into pairs, rotating about antipodal points. We extend this situation to also describe the dynamics of other configurations of defects. For example, two +1 defects are found to attract or repel according to the local geometric character of the director field around them and the extensile or contractile nature of the material, while additional pairs of opposite charge defects can give rise to flow states containing more than two vortices. Finally, we describe the generic relationship between defects in the orientation and singular points of the flow, and suggest implications for the three-dimensional nature of the flow and deformation in the shape of the shell.},

@article{roux2002,
	abstract = {The elucidation of physical and molecular mechanisms by which a membrane tube is generated from a membrane reservoir is central to the understanding of the structure and dynamics of intracellular organelles and of transport intermediates in eukaryotic cells. Compelling evidence exists that molecular motors of the dynein and kinesin families are involved in the tubulation of organelles. Here, we show that lipid giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), to which kinesin molecules have been attached by means of small polystyrene beads, give rise to membrane tubes and to complex tubular networks when incubated in vitro with microtubules and ATP. Similar tubes and networks are obtained with GUVs made of purified Golgi lipids, as well as with Golgi membranes. No tube formation was observed when kinesins were directly bound to the GUV membrane, suggesting that it is critical to distribute the load on both lipids and motors by means of beads. A kinetic analysis shows that network growth occurs in two phases: a phase in which membrane-bound beads move at the same velocity than free beads, followed by a phase in which the tube growth rate decreases and strongly fluctuates. Our work demonstrates that the action of motors bound to a lipid bilayer is sufficient to generate membrane tubes and opens the way to well controlled experiments aimed at the understanding of basic mechanisms in intracellular transport.},

@article{bacia2005,
	abstract = {The existence of lipid rafts in biological membranes in vivo is still debated. In contrast, the formation of domains in model systems has been well documented. In giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) prepared from ternary mixtures of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/cholesterol, a clear separation of liquid-disordered and sphingomyelin-enriched, liquid-ordered phases could be observed. This phase separation can lead to the fission of the liquid-ordered phase from the vesicle. Here we show that in cholesterol-containing GUVs, the phase separation can involve dynamic redistribution of lipids from one phase into another as a result of a cross-linking perturbation. We found that the molecular structure of a sterol used for the preparation of GUVs determines (i) its ability to induce phase separation and (ii) the curvature (positive or negative) of the formed liquid-ordered phase. As a consequence, the latter can pinch off to the outside or inside of the vesicle. Remarkably, some mixtures of sterols induce liquid-ordered domains exhibiting both positive and negative curvature, which can lead to a new type of budding behavior in GUVs. Our findings could have implications for the role of sterols in various cell-biological processes such as budding of secretory vesicles, endocytosis, or formation of multivesicular bodies.},

	abstract = { Actin is the main protein used by biological cells to adapt their structure and mechanics to their needs. Cellular adaptation is made possible by molecular processes that strongly depend on mechanics. The actin cytoskeleton is also an active material that continuously consumes energy. This allows for dynamical processes that are possible only out of equilibrium and opens up the possibility for multiple layers of control that have evolved around this single protein. Here we discuss the actin cytoskeleton from the viewpoint of physics as an active adaptive material that can build structures superior to man-made soft matter systems. Not only can actin be used to build different network architectures on demand and in an adaptive manner, but it also exhibits the dynamical properties of feedback systems, like excitability, bistability, or oscillations. Therefore, it is a prime example of how biology couples physical structure and information flow and a role model for biology-inspired metamaterials. },

	abstract = {The stresses in a closed lipid membrane described by the Helfrich Hamiltonian, quadratic in the extrinsic curvature, are identified using Noether's theorem. Three equations describe the conservation of the stress tensor: the normal projection is identified as the shape equation describing equilibrium configurations; the tangential projections are consistency conditions on the stresses which capture the fluid character of such membranes. The corresponding torque tensor is also identified. The use of the stress tensor as a basis for perturbation theory is discussed. The conservation laws are cast in terms of the forces and torques on closed curves. As an application, the first integral of the shape equation for axially symmetric configurations is derived by examining the forces which are balanced along the circles of constant latitude.},

@article{khaliullin2018,
	abstract = {To ensure timely cytokinesis, the equatorial actomyosin contractile ring constricts at a relatively constant rate despite its progressively decreasing size. Thus, the per-unit-length constriction rate increases as ring perimeter decreases. To understand this acceleration, we monitored cortical surface and ring component dynamics during the first cytokinesis of the \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} embryo. We found that, per unit length, the amount of ring components (myosin, anillin) and the constriction rate increase with parallel exponential kinetics. Quantitative analysis of cortical flow indicated that the cortex within the ring is compressed along the axis perpendicular to the ring, and the per-unit-length rate of cortical compression increases during constriction in proportion to ring myosin. We propose that positive feedback between ring myosin and compression-driven flow of cortex into the ring drives an exponential increase in the per-unit-length amount of ring myosin to maintain a high ring constriction rate and support this proposal with an analytical mathematical model.},

@article{spira2017,
	abstract = {The actomyosin ring generates force to ingress the cytokinetic cleavage furrow in animal cells, yet its filament organization and the mechanism of contractility is not well understood. We quantified actin filament order in human cells using fluorescence polarization microscopy and found that cleavage furrow ingression initiates by contraction of an equatorial actin network with randomly oriented filaments. The network subsequently gradually reoriented actin filaments along the cell equator. This strictly depended on myosin II activity, suggesting local network reorganization by mechanical forces. Cortical laser microsurgery revealed that during cytokinesis progression, mechanical tension increased substantially along the direction of the cell equator, while the network contracted laterally along the pole-to-pole axis without a detectable increase in tension. Our data suggest that an asymmetric increase in cortical tension promotes filament reorientation along the cytokinetic cleavage furrow, which might have implications for diverse other biological processes involving actomyosin rings.},

To date, many modeling research has focused on the crawling-based Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd) cells migration induced by chemotaxis, yet recent experimental results reveal that even without adhesion or contact to a substrate, Dd cells can still swim to follow chemoattractant signals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to investigate the chemotaxis induced amoeboid cell swimming dynamics. A minimal swimming system consists of one deformable Dd amoeboid cell and a dilute suspension of bacteria, and the bacteria produce chemoattractant signals that attract the Dd cell. We use the mathematical amoeba model to generate Dd cell deformation and solve the resulting low Reynolds number flows, and use a moving mesh based finite volume method to solve the reaction--diffusion--convection equation. Using the computational model, we show that chemotaxis guides a swimming Dd cell to follow and catch bacteria, while on the other hand, bacterial rheotaxis may help the bacteria to escape from the predator Dd cell.},

The combination of a nonlinear reaction--diffusion model of cell polarization, noisy bistable kinetics, and a dynamic phase field for the cell shape permits us to capture the key features of this complex system to investigate several motility scenarios, including amoeboid and fan-shaped forms as well as intermediate states with distinct displacement mechanisms. We compare the numerical simulations of our model to live cell imaging experiments of motile Dictyostelium discoideum cells under different developmental conditions.

From a knowledge of the reaction rates for reactants in solution and of their diffusion constants both in solution and on membranes, it is possible to estimate reaction rates for membrane-bound reactants. Two models are developed for predicting the rate of bond formation between cells and are compared with experiments. The force required to separate two cells is shown to be greater than the expected electrical forces between cells, and of the same order of magnitude as the forces required to pull gangliosides and perhaps some integral membrane proteins out of the cell membrane.},

For example, at the onset of meiosis in starfish oocytes a contractile F-actin network forms in the nuclear region transporting embedded chromosomes to the assembling microtubule spindle. Here, we addressed the mechanism driving contraction of this 3D disordered F-actin network by comparing quantitative observations to computational models. We analyzed 3D chromosome trajectories and imaged filament dynamics to monitor network behavior under various physical and chemical perturbations. We found no evidence of myosin activity driving network contractility. Instead, our observations are well explained by models based on a disassembly-driven contractile mechanism. We reconstitute this disassembly-based contractile system \textit{in silico} revealing a simple architecture that robustly drives chromosome transport to prevent aneuploidy in the large oocyte, a prerequisite for normal embryonic development.},

Stress fibers are thus critical for developmental morphogenesis. The most prominent actomyosin bundles, ventral stress fibers, are generated through coalescence of pre-existing stress fiber precursors. However, whether stress fibers can assemble through other mechanisms has remained elusive. We report that stress fibers can also form without requirement of pre-existing actomyosin bundles. These structures, which we named cortical stress fibers, are embedded in the cell cortex and assemble preferentially underneath the nucleus. In this process, non-muscle myosin II pulses orchestrate the reorganization of cortical actin meshwork into regular bundles, which promote reinforcement of nascent focal adhesions, and subsequent stabilization of the cortical stress fibers. These results identify a new mechanism by which stress fibers can be generated \textit{de novo} from the actin cortex and establish role for stochastic myosin pulses in the assembly of functional actomyosin bundles.},

	abstract = {Summary
	Actomyosin contractility plays a central role in a wide range of cellular processes, including the establishment of cell polarity, cell migration, tissue integrity, and morphogenesis during development. The contractile response is variable and depends on actomyosin network architecture and biochemical composition. To determine how this coupling regulates actomyosin-driven contraction, we used a micropatterning method that enables the spatial control of actin assembly. We generated a variety of actin templates and measured how defined actin structures respond to myosin-induced forces. We found that the same actin filament crosslinkers either enhance or inhibit the contractility of a network, depending on the organization of actin within the network. Numerical simulations unified the roles of actin filament branching and crosslinking during actomyosin contraction. Specifically, we introduce the concept of ``network connectivity'' and show that the contractions of distinct actin architectures are described by the same master curve when considering their degree of connectivity. This makes it possible to predict the dynamic response of defined actin structures to transient changes in connectivity. We propose that, depending on the connectivity and the architecture, network contraction is dominated by either sarcomeric-like or buckling mechanisms. More generally, this study reveals how actin network contractility depends on its architecture under a defined set of biochemical conditions.},

Additionally, actomyosin bundles devoid of this organization are known to contract both in vivo and in vitro, which cannot be described by standard muscle models. To narrow down the search for possible contraction mechanisms in these systems, we investigate their microscopic symmetries. We show that contractile behavior requires non-identical motors that generate large-enough forces to probe the nonlinear elastic behavior of F-actin. This suggests a role for filament buckling in the contraction of these bundles, consistent with recent experimental results on reconstituted actomyosin bundles.},

	abstract = {Myosin-driven contraction of the actin cytoskeleton is at the base of cell and tissue morphogenesis. At the molecular level, myosin motors drive contraction by sliding actin filaments past one another using energy produced by ATP hydrolysis. How this microscopic sliding activity gives rise to cell-scale contractions has been an active research question first in muscle cells, and over the last few decades in non-muscle cells. While many early investigations focused on myosin motor activity, increasingly, the nanoscale architecture of the actin network emerges as a key regulator of contractility. Here we review theoretical and in vitro reconstitution studies that have uncovered some of the key mechanisms by which actin network organization controls contractile tension generation. We then discuss recent findings indicating that similar principles apply in cells.},

@article{kollmannsberger2011,
	abstract = { Living cells are an active soft material with fascinating mechanical properties. Under mechanical loading, cells exhibit creep and stress relaxation behavior that follows a power-law response rather than a classical exponential response. Such a response puts cells in the context of soft colloidal glasses and other disordered metastable materials that share the same properties. In cells, however, both the power-law exponent and stiffness are related to the contractile prestress in the cytoskeleton. In addition, cells are made of a highly nonlinear material that stiffens and fluidizes under mechanical stress. They show active and adaptive mechanical behavior such as contraction and remodeling that sets them apart from any other nonliving material. Strikingly, all these observations can be linked by simple relationships with the power-law exponent as the only organizing parameter. Current theoretical models capture specific facets of cell mechanical behavior, but a comprehensive understanding is still emerging. },

	abstract = {Forces and stresses generated by the action of myosin minifilaments are analyzed in idealized computer-generated actin bundles, and compared to results for isotropic actin networks. The bundles are generated as random collections of actin filaments in two dimensions with constrained orientations, crosslinked and attached to two fixed walls. Myosin minifilaments are placed on actin filament pairs and allowed to move and deform the network so that it exerts forces on the walls. The vast majority of simulation runs end with contractile minifilament stress, because minifilaments rotate into energetically stable contractile configurations. This process is aided by the bending and stretching of actin filaments, which accomodate minifilament rotation. Stresses for bundles are greater than those for isotropic networks, and antiparallel filaments generate more tension than parallel filaments. The forces transmitted by the actin network to the walls of the simulation cell often exceed the tension in the minifilament itself.},

@article{yu2018,
	abstract = {Actomyosin contractility regulates various biological processes, including cell migration and cytokinesis. The cell cortex underlying the membrane of eukaryote cells exhibits dynamic contractile behaviors facilitated by actomyosin contractility. Interestingly, the cell cortex shows reversible aggregation of actin and myosin called ``pulsed contraction'' in diverse cellular phenomena, such as embryogenesis and tissue morphogenesis. Although contractile behaviors of actomyosin machinery have been studied extensively in several in vitro experiments and computational studies, none of them successfully reproduced the pulsed contraction observed in vivo. Recent experiments have suggested the pulsed contraction is dependent upon the spatiotemporal expression of a small GTPase protein called RhoA. This only indicates the significance of biochemical signaling pathways during the pulsed contraction. In this study, we reproduced the pulsed contraction with only the mechanical and dynamic behaviors of cytoskeletal elements. First, we observed that small pulsed clusters or clusters with fluctuating sizes may appear when there is subtle balance between force generation from motors and force relaxation induced by actin turnover. However, the size and duration of these clusters differ from those of clusters observed during the cellular phenomena. We found that clusters with physiologically relevant size and duration can appear only with both actin turnover and angle-dependent F-actin severing resulting from buckling induced by motor activities. We showed how parameters governing F-actin severing events regulate the size and duration of pulsed clusters. Our study sheds light on the underestimated significance of F-actin severing for the pulsed contraction observed in physiological processes.},

	abstract = {The actomyosin cell cortex is an active contractile material for driving cell- and tissue morphogenesis. The cortex has a tendency to form a pattern of myosin foci, which is a signature of potentially unstable behavior. How a system that is prone to such instabilities can rveliably drive morphogenesis remains an outstanding question. Here, we report that in the \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} zygote, feedback between active RhoA and myosin induces a contractile instability in the cortex. We discover that an independent RhoA pacemaking oscillator controls this instability, generating a pulsatory pattern of myosin foci and preventing the collapse of cortical material into a few dynamic contracting regions. Our work reveals how contractile instabilities that are natural to occur in mechanically active media can be biochemically controlled to robustly drive morphogenetic events.},

@article{thomas2012,
	abstract = {Progress in live-cell imaging of the cytoskeleton has significantly extended our knowledge about the organization and dynamics of actin filaments near the plasma membrane of plant cells. Noticeably, two populations of filamentous structures can be distinguished. On the one hand, fine actin filaments which exhibit an extremely dynamic behavior basically characterized by fast polymerization and prolific severing events, a process referred to as actin stochastic dynamics. On the other hand, thick actin bundles which are composed of several filaments and which are comparatively more stable although they constantly remodel as well. There is evidence that the actin cytoskeleton plays critical roles in trafficking and signaling at both the cell cortex and organelle periphery but the exact contribution of actin bundles remains unclear. A common view is that actin bundles provide the long-distance tracks used by myosin motors to deliver their cargo to growing regions and accordingly play a particularly important role in cell polarization. However, several studies support that actin bundles are more than simple passive highways and display multiple and dynamic roles in the regulation of many processes, such as cell elongation, polar auxin transport, stomatal and chloroplast movement, and defense against pathogens. The list of identified plant actin-bundling proteins is ever expanding, supporting that plant cells shape structurally and functionally different actin bundles. Here I review the most recently characterized actin-bundling proteins, with a particular focus on those potentially relevant to membrane trafficking and/or signaling.},

@article{loose2011,
	abstract = { One of the most fundamental features of biological systems is probably their ability to self-organize in space and time on different scales. Despite many elaborate theoretical models of how molecular self-organization can come about, only a few experimental systems of biological origin have so far been rigorously described, due mostly to their inherent complexity. The most promising strategy of modern biophysics is thus to identify minimal biological systems showing self-organized emergent behavior. One of the best-understood examples of protein self-organization, which has recently been successfully reconstituted in vitro, is represented by the oscillations of the Min proteins in Escherichia coli. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanism of Min protein self-organization in vivo and in vitro. We discuss the potential of the Min oscillations to sense the geometry of the cell and suggest that spontaneous protein waves could be a general means of intracellular organization. We hypothesize that cooperative membrane binding and unbinding, e.g., as an energy-dependent switch, may act as an important regulatory mechanism for protein oscillations and pattern formation in the cell. },

@article{kumar2018,
	abstract = {Activity tunes elastic properties and defect interactions in nematic liquid crystals. Active materials are capable of converting free energy into directional motion, giving rise to notable dynamical phenomena. Developing a general understanding of their structure in relation to the underlying nonequilibrium physics would provide a route toward control of their dynamic behavior and pave the way for potential applications. The active system considered here consists of a quasi--two-dimensional sheet of short (≈1 μm) actin filaments driven by myosin II motors. By adopting a concerted theoretical and experimental strategy, new insights are gained into the nonequilibrium properties of active nematics over a wide range of internal activity levels. In particular, it is shown that topological defect interactions can be led to transition from attractive to repulsive as a function of initial defect separation and relative orientation. Furthermore, by examining the +1/2 defect morphology as a function of activity, we found that the apparent elastic properties of the system (the ratio of bend-to-splay elastic moduli) are altered considerably by increased activity, leading to an effectively lower bend elasticity. At high levels of activity, the topological defects that decorate the material exhibit a liquid-like structure and adopt preferred orientations depending on their topological charge. Together, these results suggest that it should be possible to tune internal stresses in active nematic systems with the goal of designing out-of-equilibrium structures with engineered dynamic responses.},

Rheol., 34 (1990) 55--78, for a class of incompressible fluids, is used here in order to generate a constitutive equation for the stress and the order parametr tensor for a polymeric liquid crystal. A free energy expression, of the type used by Doi in his theory for concentrated solutions of rigid rods, is used in addition to the Frank elasticity expression employed in the Leslie---Ericksen---Parodi (LEP) theory to model the effect of spatial gradients in the liquid crystalline microstructure. For homogeneous systems, the analysis leads to a model which is equivalent to a generalization of Doi theory out to fourth-order terms in S. Truncating this model at second-order terms gives the Doi equations exactly. To evaluate the expanded model, results for steady simple shear and extensional flows are compared against the Doi model predictions. The constitutive equation resulting from the expanded model is compared against the LEP constitutive equation and the parameters between the two are correlated. The additional stress terms for non-homogeneous systems reduce to a recently presented (B.J. Edwards and A.N. Beris, J. Rheol., 33 (1989) 1189--1193; M. Grmela, Phys. Lett. A, 137 (1989) 342--348) generalization of the Ericksen stress expression in terms of the second-order parameter tensor.

The examples range from pure fluid flow, pattern selection in fluid&ndash;solid systems to chemical-reaction-induced flocking and aggregation in fluid systems. In each case, self-organization can be seen to be a function of a persistent internal gradient. One goal of this article is to hint at a common theory to explain such phenomena, which often takes the form of the extremum of some thermodynamic quantity, for instance the rate of entropy production. Such variational theories are not new; they have been in existence for decades and gained popularity through the Nobel Prize-winning work of theorists such as Lars Onsager and Ilya Prigogine. The arguments have evolved since then to include systems of higher complexity and for nonlinear systems, though a comprehensive theory remains elusive. The overall attempt is to bring out examples from physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology that reveal deep connections between variational principles in physics and biological, or living systems. There is sufficient evidence to at least raise suspicion that there exists an organization principle common to both living and non-living systems, which deserves deep attention.},

	abstract = {We study how confinement transforms the chaotic dynamics of bulk microtubule-based active nematics into regular spatiotemporal patterns. For weak confinements in disks, multiple continuously nucleating and annihilating topological defects self-organize into persistent circular flows of either handedness. Increasing confinement strength leads to the emergence of distinct dynamics, in which the slow periodic nucleation of topological defects at the boundary is superimposed onto a fast procession of a pair of defects. A defect pair migrates toward the confinement core over multiple rotation cycles, while the associated nematic director field evolves from a distinct double spiral toward a nearly circularly symmetric configuration. The collapse of the defect orbits is punctuated by another boundary-localized nucleation event, that sets up long-term doubly periodic dynamics. Comparing experimental data to a theoretical model of an active nematic reveals that theory captures the fast procession of a pair of +1/2 defects, but not the slow spiral transformation nor the periodic nucleation of defect pairs. Theory also fails to predict the emergence of circular flows in the weak confinement regime. The developed confinement methods are generalized to more complex geometries, providing a robust microfluidic platform for rationally engineering 2D autonomous flows.},

@article{doxzen2013,
	abstract = {{Collective behavior refers to the emergence of complex migration patterns over scales larger than those of the individual elements constituting a system. It plays a pivotal role in biological systems in regulating various processes such as gastrulation, morphogenesis and tissue organization. Here, by combining experimental approaches and numerical modeling, we explore the role of cell density (`crowding'), strength of intercellular adhesion (`cohesion') and boundary conditions imposed by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (`constraints') in regulating the emergence of collective behavior within epithelial cell sheets. Our results show that the geometrical confinement of cells into well-defined circles induces a persistent, coordinated and synchronized rotation of cells that depends on cell density. The speed of such rotating large-scale movements slows down as the density increases. Furthermore, such collective rotation behavior depends on the size of the micropatterned circles: we observe a rotating motion of the overall cell population in the same direction for sizes of up to 200 μm. The rotating cells move as a solid body, with a uniform angular velocity. Interestingly, this upper limit leads to length scales that are similar to the natural correlation length observed for unconfined epithelial cell sheets. This behavior is strongly altered in cells that present a downregulation of adherens junctions and in cancerous cell types. We anticipate that our system provides a simple and easy approach to investigate collective cell behavior in a well-controlled and systematic manner.}},

	abstract = {The term active nematics designates systems in which apolar elongated particles spend energy to move randomly along their axis and interact by inelastic collisions in the presence of noise. Starting from a simple Vicsek-style model for active nematics, we derive a mesoscopic theory, complete with effective multiplicative noise terms, using a combination of kinetic theory and It{\^o} calculus approaches. The stochastic partial differential equations thus obtained are shown to recover the key terms argued in Ramaswamy et al (2003 Europhys. Lett. 62 196) to be at the origin of anomalous number fluctuations and long-range correlations. Their deterministic part is studied analytically, and is shown to give rise to the long-wavelength instability at onset of nematic order (see Shi X and Ma Y 2010 arXiv:1011.5408). The corresponding nonlinear density-segregated band solution is given in a closed form.},

@article{serbus2005,
	abstract = {{Mass movements of cytoplasm, known as cytoplasmic streaming, occur in some large eukaryotic cells. In Drosophila oocytes there are two forms of microtubule-based streaming. Slow, poorly ordered streaming occurs during stages 8-10A, while pattern formation determinants such as oskar mRNA are being localized and anchored at specific sites on the cortex. Then fast well-ordered streaming begins during stage 10B, just before nurse cell cytoplasm is dumped into the oocyte. We report that the plus-end-directed microtubule motor kinesin-1 is required for all streaming and is constitutively capable of driving fast streaming. Khc mutations that reduce the velocity of kinesin-1 transport in vitro blocked streaming yet still supported posterior localization of oskar mRNA, suggesting that streaming is not essential for the oskar localization mechanism. Inhibitory antibodies indicated that the minus-end-directed motor dynein is required to prevent premature fast streaming, suggesting that slow streaming is the product of a novel dynein-kinesin competition. As F-actin and some associated proteins are also required to prevent premature fast streaming, our observations support a model in which the actin cytoskeleton triggers the shift from slow to fast streaming by inhibiting dynein. This allows a cooperative self-amplifying loop of plus-end-directed organelle motion and parallel microtubule orientation that drives vigorous streaming currents and thorough mixing of oocyte and nurse-cell cytoplasm.}},

@article{murrell2012,
	abstract = {Here we develop a minimal model of the cell actomyosin cortex by forming a quasi-2D cross-linked filamentous actin (F-actin) network adhered to a model cell membrane and contracted by myosin thick filaments. Myosin motors generate both compressive and tensile stresses on F-actin and consequently induce large bending fluctuations, which reduces their effective persistence length to \&lt;1 μm. Over a large range of conditions, we show the extent of network contraction corresponds exactly to the extent of individual F-actin shortening via buckling. This demonstrates an essential role of buckling in breaking the symmetry between tensile and compressive stresses to facilitate mesoscale network contraction of up to 80\% strain. Portions of buckled F-actin with a radius of curvature ∼300 nm are prone to severing and thus compressive stresses mechanically coordinate contractility with F-actin severing, the initial step of F-actin turnover. Finally, the F-actin curvature acquired by myosin-induced stresses can be further constrained by adhesion of the network to a membrane, accelerating filament severing but inhibiting the long-range transmission of the stresses necessary for network contractility. Thus, the extent of membrane adhesion can regulate the coupling between network contraction and F-actin severing. These data demonstrate the essential role of the nonlinear response of F-actin to compressive stresses in potentiating both myosin-mediated contractility and filament severing. This may serve as a general mechanism to mechanically coordinate contractility and cortical dynamics across diverse actomyosin assemblies in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells.},

Here we review some recent applications of lattice Boltzmann to study the hydrodynamics of liquid crystalline materials. In particular{,} we focus on the study of (a) the exotic blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystals{,} and (b) active gels---a model system for actin plus myosin solutions or bacterial suspensions. In both cases lattice Boltzmann studies have proved useful to provide new insights into these complex materials.},

	abstract = {This paper describes Ludwig, a versatile code for the simulation of Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) models in 3D on cubic lattices. In fact, Ludwig is not a single code, but a set of codes that share certain common routines, such as I/O and communications. If Ludwig is used as intended, a variety of complex fluid models with different equilibrium free energies are simple to code, so that the user may concentrate on the physics of the problem, rather than on parallel computing issues. Thus far, Ludwig's main application has been to symmetric binary fluid mixtures. We first explain the philosophy and structure of Ludwig which is argued to be a very effective way of developing large codes for academic consortia. Next we elaborate on some parallel implementation issues such as parallel I/O, and the use of MPI to achieve full portability and good efficiency on both MPP and SMP systems. Finally, we describe how to implement generic solid boundaries, and look in detail at the particular case of a symmetric binary fluid mixture near a solid wall. We present a novel scheme for the thermodynamically consistent simulation of wetting phenomena, in the presence of static and moving solid boundaries, and check its performance.},

We study the emergence of this mesoscopic nematic order by quantifying the ordering dynamics in a two-dimensional tissue. Cells are initially very motile and the monolayer is characterized by anomalous density fluctuations{,} a signature of far-from-equilibrium systems. As the cell density increases because of proliferation{,} the cells align with each other forming these large oriented domains while{,} at the same time{,} the cellular movements and the density fluctuations freeze. Topological defects that are characteristic of nematic phases remain trapped at long times thereby preventing the development of infinite domains. When confined within adhesive stripes of given widths (from 30 μm to 1.5 mm) cells spontaneously align with the domain edges. This orientation then propagates toward the pattern center. For widths smaller than the orientation correlation length{,} cells perfectly align in the direction of the stripe. Experiments performed in cross-shaped patterns show that in the situation of two competing populations{,} both the number of cells and the degree of alignment impact the final orientation.},

	abstractnote = {Living liquid crystals, a realization of active nematics where a lyotropic liquid crystal is combined with active bacteria, exhibit a plethora of out-of-equilibrium phenomena that range from active turbulence and dynamic spatiotemporal patterns to the creation and annihilation of motile topological defects. Experiments and hydrodynamic simulations are used here to report on the emergence of bend stripes, which arise as spontaneous undulations of the director field in circularly aligned lyotropic liquid crystals doped with bacteria. The interplay among bacterial-induced hydrodynamic flows and elastic forces in the material induces remarkable deformation patterns consisting of branched, radially elongated bands of a high curvature of the director field. The average number of such branches increases with the distance from the center of the circular alignment, leading to the formation of a radial tree of bands that is reminiscent of a snowflake structure. Hydrodynamic simulations, which are in agreement with the experiments, are used to explain the origin of such structures and to provide additional insights into regimes that are beyond the limit of experimental measurements. Specifically, it is found that when activity is switched off in the early stages of pattern formation, a pronounced decay of bend-distortion energy ensues, with little change of the splay energy, serving to confirm that the bend stripes are an outcome of activity-driven bend-instability phenomena. Taken together, experiments and simulations demonstrate a system in which strain and geometry can be combined to dynamically manipulate pattern formation in active matter, paving the way to a deeper understanding and finer control of active colloidal systems.},

Despite occurring in the absence of inertia, chaotic active flows are reminiscent of inertial turbulence, and hence they are known as active turbulence. Here, we survey the field, providing a unified perspective over different classes of active turbulence. To this end, we divide our review into sections for systems with either polar or nematic order, and with or without momentum conservation (wet or dry). Comparing to inertial turbulence, we highlight the emergence of power-law scaling with either universal or nonuniversal exponents. We also contrast scenarios for the transition from steady to chaotic flows, and we discuss the absence of energy cascades. We link this feature to both the existence of intrinsic length scales and the self-organized nature of energy injection in active turbulence, which are fundamental differences from inertial turbulence. We close by outlining the emerging picture, remaining challenges, and future directions. },

	Cell shape changes from locomotion to cytokinesis are, to a large extent, driven by myosin-driven remodeling of cortical actin patterns. Passive crosslinkers such as α-actinin and fascin as well as actin nucleator Arp2/3 complex largely determine actin network architecture and, consequently, membrane shape changes. Here we reconstitute actomyosin networks inside cell-sized lipid bilayer vesicles and show that depending on vesicle size and concentrations of α-actinin and fascin actomyosin networks assemble into ring and aster-like patterns. Anchoring actin to the membrane does not change actin network architecture yet exerts forces and deforms the membrane when assembled in the form of a contractile ring. In the presence of α-actinin and fascin, an Arp2/3 complex-mediated actomyosin cortex is shown to assemble a ring-like pattern at the equatorial cortex followed by myosin-driven clustering and consequently blebbing. An active gel theory unifies a model for the observed membrane shape changes induced by the contractile cortex.},

	abstract = {Keratin intermediate filaments form dynamic intracellular networks, which span the entire cytoplasm and provide mechanical strength to the cell. The mechanical resilience of the keratin intermediate filament network itself is determined by filament bundling. The bundling process can be reproduced in artificial conditions in the absence of any specific cross-linking proteins, which suggests that it is driven by generic physical forces acting between filaments. Here, we suggest a detailed model for bundling of keratin intermediate filaments based on interfilament electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. It predicts that the process is limited by an optimal bundle thickness, which is determined by the electric charge of the filaments, the number of hydrophobic residues in the constituent keratin polypeptides, and the extent to which the electrolyte ions are excluded from the bundle interior. We evaluate the kinetics of the bundling process by considering the energy barrier a filament has to overcome for joining a bundle.},

@article{rahimi2013,
	abstract = {The lateral mobility of membrane inclusions is essential in biological processes involving membrane-bound macromolecules{,} which often take place in highly curved geometries such as membrane tubes or small organelles. Probe mobility is assisted by the lateral fluidity{,} which is thought to be purely viscous for lipid bilayers and synthetic systems such as polymersomes. In previous theoretical studies{,} the hydrodynamical mobility is estimated assuming a fixed membrane geometry. However{,} fluid membranes are very flexible out-of-plane. By accounting for the deformability of the membrane and in the presence of curvature{,} we show that the lateral motion of an inclusion produces a normal force{,} which results in a nonuniform membrane deformation. Such a deformation mobilizes the bending elasticity{,} produces extra lateral viscous and elastic forces{,} and results in an effective lateral viscoelastic behavior. The coupling between lateral and out-of-plane mechanics is mediated by the interfacial hydrodynamics and curvature. We analyze the frequency and curvature dependent rheology of flexible fluid membranes{,} and interpret it with a simple four-element model{,} which provides a background for microrheological experiments. Two key technical aspects of the present work are a new formulation for the interfacial hydrodynamics{,} and the linearization of the governing equations around a cylindrical geometry.},

@article{wagner2007,
	abstract = {One cellular function of intermediate filaments is to provide cells with compliance to small deformations while strengthening them when large stresses are applied. How IFs accomplish this mechanical role is revealed by recent studies of the elastic properties of single IF protein polymers and by viscoelastic characterization of the networks they form. IFs are unique among cytoskeletal filaments in withstanding large deformations. Single filaments can stretch to more than 3 times their initial length before breaking, and gels of IF withstand strains greater than 100% without damage. Even after mechanical disruption of gels formed by crossbridged neurofilaments, the elastic modulus of these gels rapidly recovers under conditions where gels formed by actin filaments are irreversibly ruptured. The polyelectrolyte properties of IFs may enable crossbridging by multivalent counterions, but identifying the mechanisms by which IFs link into bundles and networks in vivo remains a challenge.},

	abstract = {In animals, cellularization of a coenocyte is a specialized form of cytokinesis that results in the formation of a polarized epithelium during early embryonic development. It is characterized by coordinated assembly of an actomyosin network, which drives inward membrane invaginations. However, whether coordinated cellularization driven by membrane invagination exists outside animals is not known. To that end, we investigate cellularization in the ichthyosporean \textit{Sphaeroforma arctica}, a close unicellular relative of animals. We show that the process of cellularization involves coordinated inward plasma membrane invaginations dependent on an actomyosin network and reveal the temporal order of its assembly. This leads to the formation of a polarized layer of cells resembling an epithelium. We show that this stage is associated with tightly regulated transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell adhesion. Hereby we demonstrate the presence of a self-organized, clonally-generated, polarized layer of cells in a unicellular relative of animals.},

	abstract = {Cells change their form and function by assembling actin stress fibers at their base and exerting traction forces on their extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions. Individual stress fibers are thought to be actively tensed by the action of actomyosin motors and to function as elastic cables that structurally reinforce the basal portion of the cytoskeleton; however, these principles have not been directly tested in living cells, and their significance for overall cell shape control is poorly understood. Here we combine a laser nanoscissor, traction force microscopy, and fluorescence photobleaching methods to confirm that stress fibers in living cells behave as viscoelastic cables that are tensed through the action of actomyosin motors, to quantify their retraction kinetics in situ, and to explore their contribution to overall mechanical stability of the cell and interconnected ECM. These studies reveal that viscoelastic recoil of individual stress fibers after laser severing is partially slowed by inhibition of Rho-associated kinase and virtually abolished by direct inhibition of myosin light chain kinase. Importantly, cells cultured on stiff ECM substrates can tolerate disruption of multiple stress fibers with negligible overall change in cell shape, whereas disruption of a single stress fiber in cells anchored to compliant ECM substrates compromises the entire cellular force balance, induces cytoskeletal rearrangements, and produces ECM retraction many microns away from the site of incision; this results in large-scale changes of cell shape (> 5% elongation). In addition to revealing fundamental insight into the mechanical properties and cell shape contributions of individual stress fibers and confirming that the ECM is effectively a physical extension of the cell and cytoskeleton, the technologies described here offer a novel approach to spatially map the cytoskeletal mechanics of living cells on the nanoscale.},

	abstract = { Actomyosin stress fibers (SFs) support cell shape and migration by directing intracellular tension to the extracellular matrix (ECM) via focal adhesions. Migrating cells exhibit three SF subtypes (dorsal SFs, transverse arcs, and ventral SFs), which differ in their origin, location, and ECM connectivity. While each subtype is hypothesized to play unique structural roles, this idea has not been directly tested at the single-SF level. Here, we interrogate the mechanical properties of single SFs of each subtype based on their retraction kinetics following laser incision. While each SF subtype bears distinct mechanical properties, these properties are highly interdependent, with incision of dorsal fibers producing centripetal recoil of adjacent transverse arcs and the retraction of incised transverse arcs being limited by attachment points to dorsal SFs. These observations hold whether cells are allowed to spread freely or are confined to crossbow ECM patterns. Consistent with this interdependence, subtype-specific knockdown of dorsal SFs (palladin) or transverse arcs (mDia2) influences ventral SF retraction. These altered mechanics are partially phenocopied in cells cultured on ECM microlines that preclude assembly of dorsal SFs and transverse arcs. Our findings directly demonstrate that different SF subtypes play distinct roles in generating tension and form a mechanically interdependent network. },

	abstract = { The remodelling of the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion (FA) distributions for cells on substrates with micro-patterned ligand patches is investigated using a bio-chemo-mechanical model. We investigate the effect of ligand pattern shape on the cytoskeletal arrangements and FA distributions for cells having approximately the same area. The cytoskeleton model accounts for the dynamic rearrangement of the actin/myosin stress fibres. It entails the highly nonlinear interactions between signalling, the kinetics of tension-dependent stress-fibre formation/dissolution and stress-dependent contractility. This model is coupled with another model that governs FA formation and accounts for the mechano-sensitivity of the adhesions from thermodynamic considerations. This coupled modelling scheme is shown to capture a variety of key experimental observations including: (i) the formation of high concentrations of stress fibres and FAs at the periphery of circular and triangular, convex-shaped ligand patterns; (ii) the development of high FA concentrations along the edges of the V-, T-, Y- and U-shaped concave ligand patterns; and (iii) the formation of highly aligned stress fibres along the non-adhered edges of cells on the concave ligand patterns. When appropriately calibrated, the model also accurately predicts the radii of curvature of the non-adhered edges of cells on the concave-shaped ligand patterns. },

	abstract = {The shape and differentiated state of many cell types are highly sensitive to the rigidity of the microenvironment. The physical mechanisms involved, however, are unknown. Here, we present a theoretical model and experiments demonstrating that the alignment of stress fibres within stem cells is a non-monotonic function of matrix rigidity. We treat the cell as an active elastic inclusion in a surrounding matrix, allowing the actomyosin forces to polarize in response to elastic stresses developed in the cell. The theory correctly predicts the monotonic increase of the cellular forces with the matrix rigidity and the alignment of stress fibres parallel to the long axis of cells. We show that the anisotropy of this alignment depends non-monotonically on matrix rigidity and demonstrate it experimentally by quantifying the orientational distribution of stress fibres in stem cells. These findings offer physical insight into the sensitivity of stem-cell differentiation to tissue elasticity and, more generally, introduce a cell-type-specific parameter for actomyosin polarizability.},

	abstract = {{The mechanics of the actin cytoskeleton have a central role in the regulation of cells and tissues, but the details of how molecular sensors recognize deformations and forces are elusive. By performing cytoskeleton laser nanosurgery in cultured epithelial cells and fibroblasts, we show that the retraction of stress fibers (SFs) is restricted to the proximity of the cut and that new adhesions form at the retracting end. This suggests that SFs are attached to the substrate. A new computational model for SFs confirms this hypothesis and predicts the distribution and propagation of contractile forces along the SF. We then analyzed the dynamics of zyxin, a focal adhesion protein present in SFs. Fluorescent redistribution after laser nanosurgery and drug treatment shows a high correlation between the experimentally measured localization of zyxin and the computed localization of forces along SFs. Correlative electron microscopy reveals that zyxin is recruited very fast to intermediate substrate anchor points that are highly tensed upon SF release. A similar acute localization response is found if SFs are mechanically perturbed with the cantilever of an atomic force microscope. If actin bundles are cut by nanosurgery in living Drosophila egg chambers, we also find that zyxin redistribution dynamics correlate to force propagation and that zyxin relocates at tensed SF anchor points, demonstrating that these processes also occur in living organisms. In summary, our quantitative analysis shows that force and protein localization are closely correlated in stress fibers, suggesting a very direct force-sensing mechanism along actin bundles.}},

Biomimetic materials research is becoming a rapidly growing and enormously promising field.

@article{yates2009,
	abstract = {Among the most striking aspects of the movement of many animal groups are their sudden coherent changes in direction. Recent observations of locusts and starlings have shown that this directional switching is an intrinsic property of their motion. Similar direction switches are seen in self-propelled particle and other models of group motion. Comprehending the factors that determine such switches is key to understanding the movement of these groups. Here, we adopt a coarse-grained approach to the study of directional switching in a self-propelled particle model assuming an underlying one-dimensional Fokker--Planck equation for the mean velocity of the particles. We continue with this assumption in analyzing experimental data on locusts and use a similar systematic Fokker--Planck equation coefficient estimation approach to extract the relevant information for the assumed Fokker--Planck equation underlying that experimental data. In the experiment itself the motion of groups of 5 to 100 locust nymphs was investigated in a homogeneous laboratory environment, helping us to establish the intrinsic dynamics of locust marching bands. We determine the mean time between direction switches as a function of group density for the experimental data and the self-propelled particle model. This systematic approach allows us to identify key differences between the experimental data and the model, revealing that individual locusts appear to increase the randomness of their movements in response to a loss of alignment by the group. We give a quantitative description of how locusts use noise to maintain swarm alignment. We discuss further how properties of individual animal behavior, inferred by using the Fokker--Planck equation coefficient estimation approach, can be implemented in the self-propelled particle model to replicate qualitatively the group level dynamics seen in the experimental data.},

	abstract = { Cortical flow, the directed movement of cortical F-actin and cortical organelles, is a basic cellular motility process. Microtubules are thought to somehow direct cortical flow, but whether they do so by stimulating or inhibiting contraction of the cortical actin cytoskeleton is the subject of debate. Treatment ofXenopus oocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) triggers cortical flow toward the animal pole of the oocyte; this flow is suppressed by microtubules. To determine how this suppression occurs and whether it can control the direction of cortical flow, oocytes were subjected to localized manipulation of either the contractile stimulus (PMA) or microtubules. Localized PMA application resulted in redirection of cortical flow toward the site of application, as judged by movement of cortical pigment granules, cortical F-actin, and cortical myosin-2A. Such redirected flow was accelerated by microtubule depolymerization, showing that the suppression of cortical flow by microtubules is independent of the direction of flow. Direct observation of cortical F-actin by time-lapse confocal analysis in combination with photobleaching showed that cortical flow is driven by contraction of the cortical F-actin network and that microtubules suppress this contraction. The oocyte germinal vesicle serves as a microtubule organizing center inXenopus oocytes; experimental displacement of the germinal vesicle toward the animal pole resulted in localized flow away from the animal pole. The results show that 1) cortical flow is directed toward areas of localized contraction of the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton; 2) microtubules suppress cortical flow by inhibiting contraction of the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton; and 3) localized, microtubule-dependent suppression of actomyosin-based contraction can control the direction of cortical flow. We discuss these findings in light of current models of cortical flow. },

The algorithms use a multifrontal approach and are especially designed to cover a large class of problems. The problems can be symmetric positive definite, general symmetric, or unsymmetric matrices, both possibly rank deficient, and they can be provided by the user in several formats. The algorithms achieve high performance by exploiting parallelism coming from the sparsity in the problem and that available for dense matrices. The algorithms use a dynamic distributed task scheduling technique to accommodate numerical pivoting and to allow the migration of computational tasks to lightly loaded processors. Large computational tasks are divided into subtasks to enhance parallelism. Asynchronous communication is used throughout the solution process to efficiently overlap communication with computation.We illustrate our design choices by experimental results obtained on an SGI Origin 2000 and an IBM SP2 for test matrices provided by industrial partners in the PARASOL project. },

	abstract = {Cell movement is a complex phenomenon that is fundamental to many physiological and disease processes. It has been the subject of study for more than 200 years, and yet we still do not fully understand this process. Cell movement consists of four steps; protrusion and adhesion formation at the front followed by contractile force generation and detachment at the rear. Much is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these steps however, it is not clear how they are integrated at the cellular level. Part of the problem is the incorporation of a vast amount of molecular and biophysical data into a basic working model of motility. A promising solution to this problem is the combined approach of mathematical modeling and experimentation, using the fish epithelial keratocyte as a model system. The goal of this review is to illustrate, using examples, how the reciprocity between experimentation and modeling can provide new insights into the mechanism of cell motility. Several modeling approaches are described including: conceptual models, ``bottom-up'' models based on molecular dynamics, and ``top-down'' models that consider cell shape and movement. The Graded Radial Extension (GRE) model forms the basis of a several mathematical models, from a simpler 1D model that links actin filament dynamics to cell shape, to more complex 2D and 3D simulations of keratocyte movement. Together these models suggest that cell movement emerges from the mechanical interaction between different sub-processes of motility, namely, the treadmilling actin meshwork, the plasma membrane, adhesion turnover and contractile force generation. In addition, the feedback regulation between these sub-processes is important for the robust, self-organizing nature of movement.},

Similarly, the characteristic length of stress propagation (the hydrodynamic length λ) sets the length scale of slow deformations, and a large hydrodynamic length is a prerequisite for long-ranged cortical flows. Here we introduce a method to determine physical parameters of the actomyosin cortical layer in vivo directly from laser ablation experiments. For this we investigate the cortical response to laser ablation in the one-cell-stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo and in the gastrulating zebrafish embryo. These responses can be interpreted using a coarse-grained physical description of the cortex in terms of a two-dimensional thin film of an active viscoelastic gel. To determine the Maxwell time τM, the hydrodynamic length λ, the ratio of active stress ζΔμ, and per-area friction γ, we evaluated the response to laser ablation in two different ways: by quantifying flow and density fields as a function of space and time, and by determining the time evolution of the shape of the ablated region. Importantly, both methods provide best-fit physical parameters that are in close agreement with each other and that are similar to previous estimates in the two systems. Our method provides an accurate and robust means for measuring physical parameters of the actomyosin cortical layer. It can be useful for investigations of actomyosin mechanics at the cellular-scale, but also for providing insights into the active mechanics processes that goverue-scale morphogenesis.},

@article{Michael2017,
	abstract = {<p style='text-indent:20px;'>The large-scale, near-surface flow of the mid-latitude oceans is dominated by the presence of a larger, anticyclonic and a smaller, cyclonic gyre. The two gyres share the eastward extension of western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream or Kuroshio, and are induced by the shear in the winds that cross the respective ocean basins. This physical phenomenology is described mathematically by a hierarchy of systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). We study the low-frequency variability of this wind-driven, double-gyre circulation in mid-latitude ocean basins, subject to time-constant, purely periodic and more general forms of time-dependent wind stress. Both analytical and numerical methods of dynamical systems theory are applied to the PDE systems of interest. Recent work has focused on the application of non-autonomous and random forcing to double-gyre models. We discuss the associated pullback and random attractors and the non-uniqueness of the invariant measures that are obtained. The presentation moves from observations of the geophysical phenomena to modeling them and on to a proper mathematical understanding of the models thus obtained. Connections are made with the highly topical issues of climate change and climate sensitivity.</p>},

	abstract = {The ability to control the assembly and disassembly dynamics of actin filaments is an essential property of the cellular cytoskeleton. While many different proteins are known which accelerate the polymerization of monomers into filaments or promote their disintegration, much less is known on mechanisms which guarantee the kinetic stability of the cytoskeletal filaments. Previous studies indicate that cross-linking molecules might fulfill these stabilizing tasks, which in addition facilitates their ability to regulate the organization of cytoskeletal structures in vivo. The effect of depolymerization factors on such structures or the mechanism which leads finally to their disintegration remain unknown. Here, we use multiple depolymerization methods in order to directly demonstrate that cross-linking and bundling proteins effectively suppress the actin depolymerization in a concentration dependent manner. Even the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin is not sufficient to facilitate a fast disintegration of highly cross-linked actin networks unless molecular motors are used simultaneously. The drastic modification of actin kinetics by cross-linking molecules can be expected to have wide-ranging implications for our understanding of the cytoskeleton, where cross-linking molecules are omnipresent and essential.},

@article{Verkhovsky1997,
	abstract = {{The polarity of actin filaments is fundamental for the subcellular mechanics of actin-myosin interaction; however, little is known about how actin filaments are oriented with respect to myosin in non-muscle cells and how actin polarity organization is established and maintained. Here we approach these questions by investigating changes in the organization and polarity of actin relative to myosin II during actin filament translocation. Actin and myosin II reorganization was followed both kinetically, using microinjected fluorescent analogs of actin and myosin, and ultrastructurally, using myosin S1 decoration and immunogold labelling, in cultured fibroblasts that were induced to contract by treatment with cytochalasin D. We observed rapid (within 15 minutes) formation of ordered actin filament arrays: short tapered bundles and aster-like assemblies, in which filaments had uniform polarity with their barbed ends oriented toward the aggregate of myosin II at the base of a bundle or in the center of an aster. The resulting asters further interacted with each other and aggregated into bigger asters. The arrangement of actin in asters was in sharp contrast to the mixed polarity of actin filaments relative to myosin in non-treated cells. At the edge of the cell, actin filaments became oriented with their barbed ends toward the cell center; that is, the orientation was opposite to what was observed at the edge of nontreated cells. This rearrangement is indicative of relative translocation of actin and myosin II and of the ability of myosin II to sort actin filaments with respect to their polarity during translocation. The results suggest that the myosin II-actin system of non-muscle cells is organized as a dynamic network where actin filament arrangement is defined in the course of its interaction with myosin II.}},
